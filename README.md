# Rainfall_Prediction_ML_Model
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical weather data and build a predictive model that can forecast whether it will rain or not. Such a system can be useful for farmers, disaster management, and weather forecasting applications.
